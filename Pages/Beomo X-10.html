            <br/>
            Deemed as "the cute robot" by our costumers, Kawaiibot is the loveliest robot among FutureZoid's robots collection. Kawaiibot does not<br/>
            only remove the burden of house chores from your back but also can be the best friend to your kid. As many prestigious researches,<br/>
            including APS' researches, have shown and still show,  Austistic children with the company of Kawaiibot are 25% more likely to socialize<br/>
            and interact fearlessly with people more than the autistic children who sorrowfully do not have the company of Kawaiibot, for the unique<br/>
            social experience Kawaiibot can give to children, especially the Autistic ones. Integrated with the "sweet" algorithms, Kawaiibot is sociable<br/>
            and can say humorous jokes!Inside
