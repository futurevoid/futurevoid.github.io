                    Created by the recepient of Nobel prize in Medicine or Physiology in the year 2067 Proffesor Albert Twain with the cooperation of 
                    FutureZoid's world-class , optical-related engineers, Z-Glasses, or the "wonder" glasses, can function in many ways that brings the 
                    utmost benefit to it user. First of all, Z-Glasses can ber used for medical purposes : automatically adjusting to a person's near-
                    sighted or far-sighted eyes and ,most importantly, letting a blind person so visualize the physical appearence of his or her surroundings!
                    Second, Z-Glasses can be used as a lightweight , mobile microscope that gives the opportunity to a curious person to see the tiny world
                    of microbes. Third,and last of all,you can use Z-Glasses to see the surrounding before you in pitch black darkness, and you can use Z-Glasses
                    to record videos and photos, to map a room and look for hidden or lost objects, and ,connected with a simple mobile app,to call others, 
                    measure your heart rate, search in Google search engine through the orders the person gives !
