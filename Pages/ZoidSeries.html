                        started to be a serious problem for me. So, many friends and co-workers advised me to buy a flying car,but I initially disaproved.
                        However,my opinion changed after I bought the meduim-sized Z-SoundBreaker.It made my life way easier,comfortable, and travelling 
                        with my Z-SoundBreaker is the best event my family and I await."
