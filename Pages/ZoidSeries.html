                    Our Q-Zoid Series(ZYROUS 15 to ZEPHRUS 20),comprising the most powerful and trusted Quantum computer series
                    ever created by FutureZoid's computer scientists and engineers, are the most marvelous and extraordinary computer
                    series ever produced and manufactured in the mankind's computational history. Our Q-Zoid Series success is attributed 
                    manily to its use of quantum computation system , in which the computer system uses qubits instead of classical binary bits.
                    In addition to the powerful computation system the Q-ZoidSeries laptops are equipped with, a Q-Zoid laptop or PC contains
                    unique computer parts . The first computer part is the monstrous CPU on the right that has a BASE CLOCK of 4.5 GHz, a BOOST 
                    CLOCK of 5.7 , a 40 MB Cache memory , 64 Cores, and 128 threads. The second part is the 1 TB RAM that has a speed of 8800MHZ. 
                    The third part is the GPU that has a BOOST CLOCK of 6.2 GHZ and a 40 GB memory. The fourth and last part is the M.5 SSD with 
                    a WriteSpeed of 5000 MB/s and a 8400 MB/s.

                    <p> " I bought one of Q-ZoidSeries's PCs and laptops ,and the Q-Zoid laptop actually enhanced my computational life
                        as stated in the FutureZoid's official website. Before I buy the Q-Zoid laptop, I could not imagine that it would
                        make my life easier.I can download thousands of heavy photos and files without annoying lagging and overheating 
                        as other laptops I bought before had, and the costumers service is super awesome!"
